 Echoes of the Lost Realm
When you load up the game, it will go straight to the shop where you choose a gun. Once a gun is selected, the game will go to the first arena where the player can kill enemies. The player earns 50 realmGold coins per kill and you can see the money earnt in the gameplay in real time. For the prototype, if the player gets 1000 realmGold, you win the game. Then with the player’s earnt money, the player can access the inventory by pressing I inventory and then pressing a button to go to the shop to purchase more guns. This is the features we have implemented so far for the prototype. For the final game we are going to add features like the armour for the player and some special item like a mushroom to increase the player’s stamina, add more arenas and etc. The arenas will be designed and created in detailed in order to create that realistic environment for the player.
